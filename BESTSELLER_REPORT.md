## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### How This Book Stands Out

**vs Technical Books:**
- NOT a programming tutorial
- NOT about frameworks or languages
- ABOUT the human doing the programming

**vs Generic Productivity Books:**
- NOT generic "wake up at 5 AM" advice
- NOT one-size-fits-all systems
- SPECIFICALLY for developers and tech workers

**vs "Agilmente" by Bachrach:**
- Similar divulgación style and tone
- Applied to software development context
- More emphasis on flow states and deep work
- Includes modern topics (AI, remote work, on-call)

**Unique Position:**
"The first divulgación book that explains the neuroscience of programming and gives developers permission to work differently."
